    <p>I like to paint. I have won few prizes in the past. Its like a habit to me, I paint when I get time during my busy schedule.</p>
    <h3>Guardian: The Lonely and Great God</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favourite movie. Hero, a decorated military general from the Goryeo Dynasty, is framed as a traitor and killed by the young king. Years after his death, he is cursed by the Almighty to stay immortal forever, enduring the pain of seeing his loved ones die as punishment for the soldiers he killed to protect his country. He becomes an immortal goblin, helping people with his powers and being a kind man in spite of his grieving past. The only way to put an end to his immortality is the Goblin's bride, whose aid in pulling out the sword will end his painful immortality.</p>
